## Hi, I’m Adam

I’m a data scientist with experience in machine learning, NLP, and applied analytics, currently working in the health insurance space. 
I previously worked as a consultant in a Big 4 healthcare practice, where I focused on data-driven strategy and analytics.

My technical interests include:
- Machine learning systems
- Retrieval and recommender systems
- Natural language processing
- Applied statistics and experimentation

This site is a living portfolio where I document projects, experiments, and technical writeups.
