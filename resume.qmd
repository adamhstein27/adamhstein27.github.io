### Selected Projects

**Vehicle Collisions Classifications Using Neural Networks**, Neural Networks & Advanced Deep Learning (DSAN 6600)

* Processed 60,000+ frames extracted from 1,500 dashcam videos to classify collision vs. non-collision events using spatial and temporal features
* Utilized YOLOv8 for spatial feature extraction and LSTM, GRU, and Transformer architectures for temporal sequence modeling
* Optimized deep learning pipeline with PyTorch, improving model generalization and reducing training time through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning

**Predictive Modeling of Chronic Absenteeism in U.S. Public Schools**, Statistical Learning (DSAN 5300)

* Collected and merged datasets from ~13,000 school districts covering demographic, financial, and attendance data
* Engineered predictive features to classify districts into high, medium, and low chronic absenteeism risk levels
* Implemented and compared models including Random Forests, Neural Networks, SVM, Logistic Regression, and LDA/QDA, achieving high accuracy in absenteeism risk prediction

**Data-Driven Discovery of Patterns in Music**, Data Science and Analytics (DSAN 5000)

* Collected and integrated data from the Spotify API to analyze patterns in music features, genres, and popularity
* Applied unsupervised clustering to group songs based on acoustic attributes (tempo, energy, danceability), uncovering latent structure across genres
* Built supervised regression and classification models to predict song popularity and genre, identifying key drivers of listener engagement
